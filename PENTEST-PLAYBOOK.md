## 🛠️ Common Attack Patterns

### Pattern 1: SMB Relay Attack

**When to use**: Testing SMB security and authentication relay

**Prerequisites**:
- SMB signing disabled on target
- MITM enabled with SMB interception
- Responder/ntlmrelayx running on attacker VM

**Setup**:
```bash
# On attacker VM (not NAC-Tap):
sudo responder -I eth0 -wv

# Or for relay:
sudo ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support

# On NAC-Tap WebUI:
MITM Tab → Enable MITM
Remote Attacker IP: <attacker-vm-ip>
Protocols: SMB, LLMNR, mDNS
```

**Success Indicators**:
- NTLM hashes received by Responder
- Authentication relayed to target
- Shell/code execution achieved

**Evidence to Collect**:
- Screenshot of Responder output
- Captured NTLM hash
- Relay success message
- Shell access screenshot

---

### Pattern 2: Credential Harvesting (Passive)

**When to use**: Initial reconnaissance, understanding auth patterns

**Prerequisites**:
- None (completely passive)

**Setup**:
```bash
# Just start capture
sudo python3 nac-tap.py

# In WebUI:
# Status Tab → Start Capture
# Wait and monitor Loot tab
```

**Success Indicators**:
- Credentials appear in Loot tab
- PCredz identifies usernames/passwords
- NTLM hashes captured from PCAP

**Evidence to Collect**:
- Export loot (Loot Tab → Export)
- Download PCAP
- Screenshot of captured credentials (redacted for report)

---

### Pattern 3: Credential Harvesting (MITM)

**When to use**: Testing credential security, protocol interception

**Prerequisites**:
- MITM mode enabled
- Victim traffic flowing through bridge
- Internet access enabled (for external routing if needed)

**Setup**:
```bash
# Enable MITM (WebUI):
MITM Tab → Enable MITM
→ Add intercept rules for SMB/NetBIOS, HTTP, etc.

# Run Responder or ntlmrelayx on bridge IP (10.200.66.1)
# Monitor for captured credentials
```

**Success Indicators**:
- Session count increases
- Export JSON shows captured tokens
- Can replay session in browser

**Evidence to Collect**:
- Screenshot of captured session
- Export sessions JSON
- Screenshot of successful access using token
- Timeline of capture

## 📊 Evidence Collection Best Practices

### During Attack

**Real-time Notes**:
```
Timestamp | Event | Details | Evidence File
----------|-------|---------|---------------
14:32:15  | MITM Enabled | SMB intercept | screenshot-001.png
14:35:22  | Creds captured | user: jdoe | pcap-capture-001.pcap
14:40:11  | Hash cracked | password: Spring2024! | hashcat-output.txt
```

**Screenshots to Take**:
1. NAC-Tap status page (before attack)
2. MITM configuration
3. Credential capture moment
4. Loot tab with redacted credentials
5. Successful credential use (if authorized)
6. NAC-Tap status page (after attack)

**Files to Preserve**:
- PCAP files (all of them)
- Loot JSON export
- PCredz raw output
- Responder logs (if used)
- Terminal command history

### Post-Engagement

**Data Sanitization**:
```bash
# Create sanitized copy for report
cp nac-captures/*.pcap /evidence/engagement-123/
cp loot.json /evidence/engagement-123/loot-REDACTED.json

# Edit loot-REDACTED.json:
# Replace real passwords with "***REDACTED***"
# Keep usernames for context
```

**Chain of Custody**:
```
Engagement: ACME-2025-01
Tester: [Your Name]
Date: 2025-11-08
Device: NAC-Tap Serial #12345
Data: /evidence/engagement-123/
Hash: [sha256sum of archive]
Stored: Encrypted USB drive, company safe
```

## 📝 Report Writing Templates

### Finding: Transparent MITM Attack Successful

**Title**: Network Traffic Interception via Transparent Bridge

**Risk**: High

**Description**:
During testing, a transparent network bridge was deployed inline between the target network segment and the switch. This allowed interception of all network traffic passing through the connection point.

**Evidence**:
- Deployment location: Building A, Floor 2, Network closet 2B
- Duration: 4 hours
- Traffic captured: 2.3 GB
- Credentials captured: 15 unique accounts
- See: Screenshot-001.png, capture-001.pcap

**Impact**:
- All network traffic visible to attacker
- Credentials transmitted in cleartext (HTTP, FTP, Telnet)
- NTLM authentication captured and crackable
- No detection by security monitoring

**Recommendation**:
1. Implement 802.1X port security
2. Enable SMB signing on all systems
3. Disable LLMNR and NBT-NS
4. Enforce encrypted protocols (HTTPS, SFTP, SSH)
5. Implement network anomaly detection

**CVSS**: 8.1 (High)

---

### Finding: Session Hijacking via DNS Poisoning

**Title**: Microsoft 365 Session Token Capture via MITM

**Risk**: Critical

**Description**:
Using DNS poisoning and transparent SSL interception, valid OAuth session tokens were captured for Microsoft 365 accounts. These tokens provided persistent access to corporate email, SharePoint, and Teams without requiring additional authentication.

**Evidence**:
- Attack method: Transparent MITM + Credential harvesting
- Credentials captured: 3 executive accounts
- See: Screenshot-mitm-001.png, loot.json

**Impact**:
- Persistent access to corporate M365 without credentials
- No MFA challenge during token replay
- Access to sensitive emails and documents
- Ability to send emails as captured users
- No detection by security monitoring

**Recommendation**:
1. Implement Conditional Access policies with device compliance
2. Enable Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE)
3. Reduce token lifetime to 1 hour
4. Require MFA on every token refresh
5. Implement certificate pinning on corporate devices
6. Deploy DNS security (DNSSEC, DoH)

**CVSS**: 9.4 (Critical)

# (Use WebUI: Stop Capture, Stop MITM)

# Or force kill
sudo pkill -f nac-tap.py

# Remove bridge
sudo ip link delete br0
```

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: No credentials captured after 2+ hours

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check if traffic is flowing
tcpdump -i br0 -nn -c 100

# Check if MITM is working
cat /var/log/nac-captures/nac-tap.log | grep MITM

# Check loot file
cat /var/log/nac-captures/loot.json
```

**Solutions**:
- Verify bridge is inline (check physical connections)
- Check if network is active (ping from victim device)
- Try different protocols (disable SMB, enable HTTP)
- Verify Responder is running (if using relay)

---

### Issue: MITM not capturing credentials

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check MITM status
# (WebUI: MITM Tab → Check status)

# Check if Responder is running
ps aux | grep responder

# Check bridge IP
ip addr show br0
```

**Solutions**:
- Verify MITM is enabled
- Check intercept rules are active
- Verify victim traffic is flowing through bridge
- Verify DNS poisoning is active
- Try installing CA certificate on victim device
